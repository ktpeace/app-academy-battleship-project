# app-academy-battleship-project
battleship game made in App Academy bootcamp

// IDEAL IMPROVEMENTS
// disable player clicks until AI player moves (otherwise it is possible for player to make extra moves in between and alien comments are too quickly replaced)
// improve AI: make AI player keep clicking surrounding spot where a ship has been found and not fully uncovered
// fix whatever is wrong with AA code where you can't change the ship array without the game mis-calling "game over"
// add ship placement stage
// allow two human players
// refactor messy code
